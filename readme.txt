An easy way to implement the That's Why Real User Monitoring snippet to your Wordpress sites.

== Description ==

With this plugin you can add your [That's Why](https://thatswhy.app/?ref=wordpress-plugin) snippet to your WordPress site.

This plugin adds the [That's Why Real User Monitoring](https://thatswhy.app/?ref=wordpress-plugin) service to your website. It uses an external service to collect, process, and monitor user experiences of your website visitors. This is done by including a JavaScript-snippet to your website via our Content Delivery Network (via the domain *.thatswhy.app) or your custom domain. You will need an active account on [That's Why](https://thatswhy.app/?ref=wordpress-plugin-active-account) to use this plugin.

For more information about which data That's Why is processing, you can take a look at this [Terms of Service](https://thatswhy.app/terms?ref=wordpress-plugin) & [Privacy Policy](https://thatswhy.app/privacy?ref=wordpress-plugin).
